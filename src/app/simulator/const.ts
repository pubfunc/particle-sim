 * Gravitational Constant
 * 
 * SI units: 6.674 × 10^−11 [m^3 kg^−1 s^−2]
 * 
 * In astrophysics, it is convenient to measure distances 
 * in parsecs (pc), velocities in kilometers per second (km/s) 
 * and masses in solar units M⊙. In these units, 
 * the gravitational constant is:
 * 4.302 x 10^-3 [pc M^-1 (km/s)^2]

 * The solar mass (M☉) is a standard unit of mass in astronomy, 
 * equal to approximately 2×1030 kg. It is used to indicate the 
 * masses of other stars, as well as clusters, nebulae, and galaxies. 
 * It is equal to the mass of the Sun (denoted by the solar symbol ⊙︎).
